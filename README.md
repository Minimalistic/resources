# Resources

The most important thing about designing in open source is communication. Designers are not only designers who finish a concept and »hand it off« to developers who implement it – that won’t happen. The key is continuous dialog with the people who could implement it, small steps, incremental improvements and documenting your designs clearly so it’s understandable why the changes you propose are better than the current state.


## Tools
* pen & paper for mockups. No hi-fi photoshop work needed – when we have non-interactive mockups for an interactive medium, pen & paper does the trick.
* design discussion on the issue tracker of the project. For example at [GitHub](http://github.com) – get an account, identify design issues, participate, and open new issues. Establish a »Design« tag on the tracker to group these issues, for example like in the [ownCloud issues](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues?labels=Design).
* if you want to dive into the code (awesome!) just check on the project page how to set up a development environment and get going.
